# AWS AI/ML and Cognizant AI Externship Project: Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

## Project Title: Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

### Project Description:
In this project, I focused on developing my python skills to adapt an already pre-built image classifier. 

### Specifically, I:
- Focused on developing my python skills, for example extracting image names from the folder of dog and non-dog images and building a dictionary that would be used by the classifier to label images
- Adapted the code and chose a CNN architecture for the image classifier to use
- Tested the image classifier and printed the results of the image classification

Through this project, I gained practical experience using python to adapt an already pre-built image classifier to identify dog breeds.
